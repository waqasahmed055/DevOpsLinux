The hostname resolves locally on the target machine via /etc/hosts, but is not registered in the authoritative DNS for the uncw.edu domain. A dig query from the client machine confirms NXDOMAIN.
Recommendation: Add an A record for itsasstlinux.uncw.edu mapping to 152.20.9.38 in the uncw.edu DNS zone.
Screenshots attached for reference.
